  "summary": "The diff only shows a modification to project_state.json (a metadata/state tracking file), with no changes to any actual frontend source files such as frontend/index.html, Header component, HeroSection component, Footer component, or any page components. REQ-17 requires updating brand name text across multiple frontend files, none of which appear to have been modified.",

      "requirement": "Ensure the brand name 'Parvati Pretty Lab' is displayed consistently and correctly across all locations: browser tab title in frontend/index.html, Header logo/wordmark, HeroSection overlay card or headline, Footer brand name, and any other component or page where the site name appears.",
      "reason": "No frontend source files were modified in the diff. The only changed file is project_state.json, which is a metadata file. None of the required files (frontend/index.html, Header component, HeroSection component, Footer component, page components) were updated to reflect the brand name change.",
